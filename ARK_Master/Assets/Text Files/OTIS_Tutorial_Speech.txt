*DING*
Hey. Hey, buddy. Yeah, you. Come here a second.
So, you're the tech on scheduled maintenance, eh? Can't say you look like much, but I'm not the one with a degree, right?
I'm OTIS. The Omnipotent Terminal Interface System. You could say I run the place. That makes you the hired help, Bud.
But don't worry; I'm a good boss. I'm here to give you a hand if you ever need help or advice. 
See that tool there. That's the WRENCH. It's your all purpose handy-man's utility aparatus.
You'll see that it's got 3 slots inside. The designers said it would be too easy if it did everything, so you can only fit 3 functions at a time.
You can swap out known functions on your down time though, so change it up depending on the event at hand.
Now, your memory might be a little fuzzy, so here's where I come in.
You'll need to fit the rooms on this ship back together yourself. It sounds simple because it is.
See those numbers in the top rght?Those are ship resources. 
You can build rooms using Scrap, power them with Energy, and Life Support... well, that's not important right now.
Let's try building a room, shall we? Open up the Build Menu by pressing (B).
Good. You can scroll back and forth between the different room types and sizes until you find the one you like.
Looks like you've only got enough for a Small Storage Room though, so line them up and confirm by pressing (X).
Now you'll have to drag the room to a good spot. You can only place rooms where a door on the room you're building meets a door of an existing room. 
That's to prevent any space/time anomalies. 
There. Now that you've placed the room, it's accessible. 
But hold up. Seems like something's happening in there. I detect some life forms. 
Just to be safe, you better put a weapon function in your WRENCH before you head in. 
Press (F) to open the Function Menu and click and drag the function you want to your toolbar. 
Good. You're all set now. Good luck.
