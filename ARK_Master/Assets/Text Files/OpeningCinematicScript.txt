In the first half of the 22nd century, the face of the planet was irrevocably changed.
A drastic shift in global temperatures, the loss of farmable land, drought, famine, storms that dwarfed entire landscapes in size...
Populations dropped.
And then there was war.
In desperation, the people of Earth scrambled for resources by whatever means necessary.
Natural disasters turned to man-made. Famine became weapons, and food became the most prized commodity on the planet.
Earth... our home... was destroyed.
Scorched by war, and then thrown into an eternal winter, we made our planet uninhabitable.
By the late 22nd century the survivors had banded together to construct a ship. A massive colony. An escape from Earth with a single purpose.

The journey will take hundreds of years.
To escape the passage of time the crew and passengers were put into cryo-sleep; to awaken when they arrive at a second Earth. 
But ships like this need maintenance.
That's where you come in.
You're an engineer, aren't you?
Well, time to wake up then.
There's lots to do...
